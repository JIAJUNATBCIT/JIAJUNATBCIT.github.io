                    Now that there are so many amazing website builders on the market,
                    the question of how starting a blog is a much simpler one to answer.
                    Even a complete lack of technical and design skills – or even knowledge
                    won’t prevent you from creating a blog and getting your blog live within a few hours.
                    Site builders really have lowered the barrier to entry, which is great,
                    but there are still many more failed blogs than successful ones.<br>

                    With respect, I must disagree with Mr. Zinsser.
                    We all know the most important part of any article is the title.
                    Without a compelling title, your reader won’t even get to the first sentence.
                    After the title, however, the first few sentences of your article are certainly the most important part.<br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Intelligence is fixed at birth.</li>
